## Install Tutorial on Nextjournal

The Quickstart is the easiest way to run the tutorial and you can use the Nextjournal
"Remix" feature to bring the tutorial into your own Nextjournal Clojure notebooks if you
like. However, you can import the Markdown files in this repository directly, if you would
prefer.

1. Create a new account on [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com).
1. Click "+ NEW" to create a new notebook on the [Nextjournal Dashboard](https://nextjournal.com/dashboard).
1. At the bottom of the page, choose "Import from a URL (e.g. GitHub)" and paste in the link to the file in GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb-tutorial/blob/main/1-getting-started.nextjournal.md`)
1. You do not need to name the `deps.edn` block -- the metadata names it for you.

You can now run the tutorial notebook.

## Reinstallation (for maintainers)

To reinstall the tutorial: Treat this GitHub repository as the golden store. Make edits to the Markdown file in
GitHub, then reimport the notebooks using the following instructions.

1. Log in as the `xtdb-tutorial` Nextjournal user (ask @deobald or @refset for creds, stored via `pass` `juxt.xtdb.ops/password-store` on Keybase)
2. Go to the [Nextjournal Dashboard](https://nextjournal.com/dashboard) and open notebook you want to edit.
3. Click anywhere in the document, select all (ctrl+a) and delete the contents.
4. At the bottom of the page, choose "Import from a URL (e.g. GitHub)" and paste in the link to the file in GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb-tutorial/blob/main/1-getting-started.nextjournal.md`)
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and expand the Appendix. Pull from the repo to ensure the changes are brought in
6. Click "Run All" under the Play icon to evaluate all snippets
7. Select "Publish Changes" in the share dialog
8. Check to make sure the public URLs in the `"Quickstart"` work correctly.
9. If the lessons seem out-of-order, it is because they are listed reverse-chronologically. Whatever lesson you edited, publish lessons _backward_ from that point. For example, if you edited Lesson 4, you must publish #3, #2, and finally #1 (Note if you haven't edited a lesson, you only need to re-publish the old notebook without following the import steps).

TIPS: Publish last (e.g. Tutorial #8) to first so that the notebook listing is always in the correct order, i.e. import/edit backwards from the last notebook. If necessary add a non-obvious space to the end of a paragraph so that you can re-publish an otherwise unchanged notebook. Open tutorials in multiple tabs so that you can process them more efficiently in a pipelined fashion while waiting for "Run All" commands.
